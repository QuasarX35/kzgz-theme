# gx-monokai-theme README

This theme was inspired by dkcamargox's Classic Opera GX Theme along with the syntax highlighting colors from NoThInG's One Monokai Python Theme. I might update this theme in the future to make it look nicer

dkcamargox's Classic GX Theme: https://github.com/dkcamargox/opera-gx-4-vsco <br />
nxht's One Monokai Python Theme: https://github.com/nxht/one-monokai-python  <br />

**Enjoy!**
